# Notes:

# Working:
  - group_link buttons
  - group_link_list buttons

# TODO list:
    [ ] Figure out a way to close gui after following the shortcut
    [ ] Implement something similar to the src/group_link_folder method of destroying main gui window to close
    [ ] For some reason Aliases don't work on MacOS - they open in Terminal.. Otherwise this works


  ## Link Folders:
    [x] the group_link_folder combobox option doesn't work
    [x] The combobox options are all mangled
    [x] For some reason there is no name around the frame
  
  ## Gui
    [ ] Frames are all stacked on top of each other- looks bad and is disorganized
    [ ] gui doesn't quit after it has finished doing what it's supposed to do
    - GroupLinkFolder
      [ ]Key error if item isn't selected
